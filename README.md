## 🏆 the competition

**IMC Prosperity** is a global algorithmic trading challenge hosted by [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com). Over 15 days, teams compete to generate the most **seashells** (virtual profit) by trading fictional products in a simulated market.

Each round introduces new complexities, including:
- Fair value estimation under uncertainty
- Basket arbitrage across correlated instruments
- Position limits, latency, volatility, and more
