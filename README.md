# Fat Fingers 🧠💥

Welcome to the GitHub repository of **Fat Fingers**, our team for the **IMC Prosperity 2025** algorithmic trading competition.

We are a group of five driven students and aspiring quants who competed with thousands of teams from across the globe, developing real-time market-making and arbitrage algorithms using Python. This repo contains all our trading algorithms, experiments, and backtest logs for each round.

## 🏆 the competition

**IMC Prosperity** is a global algorithmic trading competition hosted by [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com), where students build bots to trade virtual financial products and compete for seashells — the official island currency. Each round introduces new products, constraints, and market conditions.

There are two challenges in each round:
- **Algorithmic trading** 🧠 (primary component of score)
- **Manual trading** 🕹️ (live speed challenge)

Over **10,000+ teams** worldwide participated in 2025, and we proudly represented France among them.

## 📊 results so far

### Round 1 — *Basic market making: Amethysts & Starfruit*
- 🐚 **49,762 seashells** collected  
- 🌍 **1705th place overall** out of 10,000+ teams  
- 🕹️ **1467th in manual trading**
- 🇫🇷 **58th in France**

We focused on smart fair value estimation and safe order execution strategies.

### Round 2 — *Multi-product trading + baskets (in progress)*

We are currently in **Round 2**, experimenting with:
- EMA + recent mean hybrid fair values
- Dynamic volatility-aware spreads
- Basket arbitrage on PICNIC_BASKET1 and 2
- Confidence-weighted and momentum-filtered execution

So far, our best backtest:
- 💰 **112,004 seashells (local)**  
- 📈 **13,500 seashells on IMC hidden test set**

We’re aiming for **200k+** seashells by introducing regime-adaptive logic and directional alpha strategies. Stay tuned 👀
